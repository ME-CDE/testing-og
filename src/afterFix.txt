modals shouldnt be sliding when the screen size contain all the content of the modal
(This is more a suggestion to Mr George)

since details page has a new heading the padding the container seems off
(This is more a suggestion to Mr George)



cfm Page
UI
"Thanks for subscribing" text after email validated and submitted
(This is backend)



Campaign Page

green cylinder stat at the bottom not scalable for large numbers
(Waiting for endie redesign or opnion)

Transactional Page

on mobile modal content overflowing when one of the field is to long
(Text will be reduced)

(This is pending)
 
UI
table content squized before transitioning into mobile view
(To think of something)





Search Page
UI
alignment like fundraiser container
(This is to be retouched)




Start a cyptofundme
UI
campaign details:

category select element background should be transparent
(might be due to phone ui difference)

on choosing the second image only it still throw the error PLEASE SELECT ONE IMAGE since banner image is the neccesary one the error should include banner image not one image
(Not done)

selected image should be cancelable, so user can remove images not only replace them with another one.
(this is done)




Fundraiser Page
UI 
placeholder for image while till loading
also lazy loading can be applied for faster loading of the page.
(To get back to)

home fundraiser showing too much campaign, it was about six max before. 
(This is done)




Details Page
UI
placeholder for image in the slider while it still loading


Edit Campaign Page
all the limitation and flow of start a cryptofundme page should apply to edit page. because they are identical.

limitation of comment after donation

Donor email length dhould not be limited.
